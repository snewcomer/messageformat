# Command-line MessageFormat Compiler

Parses and compiles the input JSON and [.properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) file(s) of MessageFormat strings into a JS module of corresponding hierarchical functions.

## Installation

```
npm install messageformat@next messageformat-cli
```

[`messageformat`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/messageformat) is a peer dependency of `messageformat-cli`, and needs to be installed separately.

## Usage

```
npx messageformat [options] [input]
```

or

```
./node_modules/.bin/messageformat [options] [input]
```

`input` should consist of one or more files or directories, unless defined in a configuration file. Directories are recursively scanned for `.json` and `.properties` files. With multiple input files, shared parts of the start of their paths are dropped out of the generated module's structure.

## Options

In addition to defining options on the command line, options may also be set in the **`"messageformat"`** object in your **`package.json`** file, or in a **`messageformat.rc.json`** configuration file, using the long-form option names as keys. Input files and directories may also be given as an **`"include"`** array in a configuration file. Command-line options override configuration files.

### `-l lc, --locale=lc`

The locale(s) _`lc`_ to include; if multiple, first is default and others are selected by matching message key. If not set or empty, path keys matching any locale code will set the active locale, starting with a default `en` locale.

### `-n ns, --namespace=ns`

By default, output is an ES6 module with a default export; set _`ns`_ to support other environments. If _`ns`_ does not contain a `.`, the output follows an UMD pattern. For CommonJS module output, use _--namespace=module.exports_.

### `-o of, --outfile=of`

Write output to the file _`of`_. If unspecified or `-`, prints to stdout.

### `--delimiters`

Set of characters by which the file path is split into output object keys. [default: `._/` or `._\` depending on platform]

### `--eslint-disable`

Add an `/* eslint-disable */` comment as the first line of the output, to silence [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) warnings. [default: `false`]

### `--extensions`

Array or comma-separated list of file extensions to parse as source files. [default: `['.json', '.properties']`]

### `--simplify`

Simplify the output object structure, by dropping intermediate keys when those keys are shared across all objects at that level, in addition to the default filtering-out of shared keys at the root of the object. [default: `false`]

## Examples

With `messages/strings.json`, compile it into a node.js module using the default English locale:

```
npx messageformat messages/strings.json > messages/en.js
```

---

With `messages/en.json` and `messages/fr.json`, combine both into an ES6-compatible module, with the top-level keys `en` and `fr` containing functions that each use the correct language's pluralization rules:

```
npx messageformat --locale=en,fr messages/ > messages.js
```

Note: The `locale` option could be left out here if is known that the data does not include any 2-3 letter keys matching other locales.

---

Same, but with this configuration in `package.json`:

```
{
  ...,
  "messageformat": {
    "locale": ["en", "fr"],
    "include": [
      "messages/"
    ],
    "outfile": "messages.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    ...,
    "build:messages": "messageformat"
  }
}
```

```
npm run build:messages
```
